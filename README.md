## About Project

This project was built as part of SheCodes coding bootcamp I partook in. Through creating this project I was able to familiarise myself with core concepts I had been learning.

• Used useEffect to call the data in an asynchronous way for the weather forecast

• Used .map() to manipulate the JSON file received from the API

• Used axios to make a call to the weather API

• Used Geolocation to determine the users weather for their current location.

• Used Props and useState to display weather information in app.

## Built with

• React JS
• Google Fonts
• Bootstrap
• API
• Font awesome
• React loader spinner
• Axios
• HTML/ CSS / JavaScript

## Lessons Learnt

Having finished this project, here are some key areas I feel I've developed in:
• Making API calls and manipulating response data.
• Components, passing state and props to render.
• Creating layouts and components using Bootstrap

## Future Work

• Adding a small feature to each container which changes colour based on the temperature at the given location

## Acknowledgment

Open Weather API
Axios
Bootstrap

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
